## Cart
At the top of the page you can view the items that are currently in your cart. For each item there is an option to edit the quantity of books or delete the item from the cart. You can clear all items from the cart by clicking on "Reset Order". You can also confirm the order by clicking on "Place Order". This will require you to enter your username and password after which the items in the cart will be removed and sent to the "My Orders" page.
